## Making posts

You can make posts by:

- **On computers:** Using the posting form on the lefthand side
- **On tablets and phones:** Pressing the *New Post* button (sometimes just a plus sign (+) icon)

Just write what you want to say, up to 500 characters (including spaces). You can also add pictures, videos, audio, polls, emojis, and spoilers or content warnings.

### Post visibility settings

You have four options to control who can see your posts:

- **Public** (default, globe icon) lets everyone see your posts
- **Quiet public** (moon icon) is the same as *Public*, but your post won't be seen outside of your profile and your followers' Home feeds
- **Followers** (lock icon) shows your post only to people who follow you
- **Private mention** (@ icon) only shows your post to people you mention

## Feeds/timelines

There are four main feeds that Lubbock.social is separated into. This is where most of the action happens; we recommend that you take the time to get comfortable with them and learn what they each do.

In apps or on mobile devices, like tablets or phones, these may be hidden in a menu.

### Home

Your **Home** feed only shows posts from people you follow.

### Trending

The **Trending** feed shows posts, hashtags, people, and news topics that are currently trending on Lubbock.social, based on posts made in the past 2 days.

### Live feeds

**Live feeds** shows you three real-time feeds: a *This server* feed that displays all posts from Lubbock.social, an *Other servers* feed that shows all posts from *outside* Lubbock.social, and an *All* feed that combines the two.

### Notifications

**Notifications** is where you can see favorites (when someone likes your posts), boosts (when someone reshares one of your posts), mentions (when someone mentions you by @ in their post), as well as private messages and updates on polls you've voted in.

## Lists

**Lists** allow you to organize your Home feed and also create separate feeds for specific things. They can pretty much be whatever you need them to be.

## Followed hashtags

You can also follow hashtags to have quicker access to their feed.
