This guide explains how to make an account on Lubbock.social.

## Step-by-step guide

Before we begin, head to the sign-up page. From the main page of Lubbock.social:

- **On a computer or tablet:** Click the *Create account* button on the righthand side.
- **On a phone:** Tap the *Create account* button on the bottom left.
- Alternatively, use [this link](https://lubbock.social/auth/sign_up) to be taken directly to the sign-up page.

Once you are there, the next steps will be exactly the same for all devices.

### Step 1: Accept the rules

The first screen will show you the basic rules on Lubbock.social. You must agree to them to use Lubbock.social and continue signing up.

### Step 2: Enter your info

The next screen is where you will enter your account details.

Here you will choose your username, similar to your '@' on X/Twitter or Threads/Instagram, as well as your login email and password. Your username is a little bit like an email address, and this is how you'll be identified on the larger network beyond Lubbock.social (the "Fediverse"). Usernames look like this: `@YOUR_USERNAME_HERE@lubbock.social`

There are two other things you'll need to join.

- **Your date of birth.** Your date of birth will *not* be kept; it's only used to confirm that you're over the age of 18 and able to use Lubbock.social.
- **Your reason for joining.** Here you'll provide a short description of who you are and why you want to join. You don't have to write an essay, but please answer to the best of your ability.

We mostly just want to make sure that you're over 18, that you're from Lubbock or live in Lubbock, and that you're a real human being.

### Step 3: Confirm your email

This page will tell you to check your email for a confirmation link. You'll need to tap or click that link to verify your email address and activate your account.

### Step 4: Wait for approval

That's it! You've finished the registration process. Before you can access Lubbock.social, a moderator will have to review your join request and approve it. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours depending on how many people are in the queue. Just be patient. You'll get an email once you're approved.
