Welcome to **Lubbock.social**!

We provide a social media platform for Lubbock's progressive underground (as well as for the surrounding areas). Lubbock.social offers an alternative to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Bluesky, and X/Twitter. 

This server runs on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), an ActivityPub protocol-based software that allows us to communicate with the broader [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).
